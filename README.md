Ever since education became available to ordinary people, teach-
ing has become increasingly difficult. Whether because of limited
resources, poor training of teachers or the high number of students
compared to teachers, students who have trouble learning from a
homogeneous teaching system are being left behind in a time where
a good education is required in order to succeed in life.
This is where video-games can help plug the gaps in the
educational system. By using video-games to create a fun and
interactive teaching environment, students will be able to experience
a personalized education based on their learning capabilities. The
use of video-games aims at helping students that need an entirely
different teaching system to learn by creating a fun and dynamic
way to acquire and verify their knowledge on subjects that they
previously might have had trouble learning. Making this application
for the most easily accessible platform (in this case mobile phones)
will hopefully encourage students to start using it.


To import the Unity project, create a new project and copy-paste the "Assets" and "ProjectSettings" folders in the folder of the new project.
